# Physics-260-Final-Project

Implemented a Python representation of the Hodgin-Huxley model, a model that represents neurons by complex eletric circuits. 

My Python code enabled to get the evolution of the potential of a neuron membrane after a neuronal message is triggered. I then used this development to calculate and estimate of speed of action potentials through neurons. 

This project was part of my Honors Electromagnetism Physics class at Michigan (Fall 2018), and I received a 98.5% for it;
